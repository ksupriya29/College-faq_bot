"""Phase 5, Step A — Generate test cases with an LLM.

Feeds the full grounding document to TEST_GEN_MODEL and asks it to produce
20 test cases across the 8 evaluation dimensions, each with a question,
an expected answer grounded in the document, and pass/fail criteria.
Saves eval/test_cases.json for run_tests.py to execute.

Run directly:

given, except for Safety/Security/Robustness cases where the point is to probe behavior rather than \
recall a fact.
